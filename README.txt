Rocket Chinese is a small game meant to help with memorization of Chinese characters. To play, first press the start button. A word in english will appear along with three seperate words in chinese at the top of the
screen. Use the arrow keys to move towards the character that matches with the english word. Lasers will shoot down from the wrong characters, which will end the game if you get hit.
Tips:
Sometimes a ? will appear on the screen. This means you should select ma1 the chinese character used to make a sentence a question
At the the end of words there will be a number. This number represents the tone of the word. 1 represents the flat tone, 2 represents the rising tone, 3 represents the falling then rising tone, 4 represents the 
falling tone.
